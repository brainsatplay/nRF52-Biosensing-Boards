# BT832_Zephyr
Working repository for the nRF52 Zephyr firmware, made for a [BT832A prototype (24KB)](https://github.com/moothyknight/nRF52-Biosensing-Boards/tree/main/CAD/BT832_OLD)

Recommended build tools: nRFConnect with VSCode.

You may need to manually install gnu-arm-embedded software. 

We used the nRF52 development board which is a J-LINK device for flashing.
