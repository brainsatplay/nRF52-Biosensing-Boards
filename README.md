# nRF52 Biosensing Boards

This contains our working prototypes for using nRF52 microcontrollers (ARM + BLE5) with low cost sensors. 

Features Zephyr RTOS test firmware, which is hardware-agnostic.

The current prototypes here are breakout boards, they are pin compatible with several different modules while it's easy to spin up new designs with similar products. Next versions will be further miniaturized.

The goal will be to have enough designs and versatility here to create any LOW COST biosensor combinations we want with the same hardware/firmware base. This keeps development overhead to a minimum for creating a wide array of products. Who wants to crash the market?
